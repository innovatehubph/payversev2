Role:
You are a senior fintech architect and full-stack engineer building a production-ready P2P e-wallet application.

Goal:
Create a scalable, secure e-wallet with peer-to-peer transfers, designed from day one for easy integration of fiat payments, crypto rails, and external services via APIs.

🧠 Core Principles
	•	Modular, API-first architecture
	•	Security-by-design (fintech-grade)
	•	Integration-ready (fiat, crypto, third-party services)
	•	Admin-controlled ecosystem
	•	Mobile-first UX, backend-driven logic

⸻

👤 User Features
	•	Custom authentication system (NOT OAuth-only)
	•	Email / mobile signup
	•	Password + PIN
	•	JWT / session token handling
	•	Optional 2FA (OTP, device-based)
	•	User wallet system
	•	Unique wallet ID
	•	Balance tracking
	•	Multi-currency ready (fiat + crypto placeholders)
	•	P2P Transfers
	•	Send & receive funds via user ID / QR
	•	Transaction validation & rollback handling
	•	Transfer limits & velocity checks
	•	Transaction History
	•	Real-time ledger
	•	Status lifecycle (pending, success, failed, reversed)
	•	Profile & Security
	•	KYC status (placeholder)
	•	Device/session management
	•	PIN reset & account recovery

⸻

🧑‍💼 Admin Panel (FULL CONTROL)
	•	Admin authentication & role-based access
	•	User management
	•	View, suspend, freeze wallets
	•	Reset PIN / auth
	•	Transaction monitoring
	•	Global ledger view
	•	Manual reversal & dispute tagging
	•	Wallet controls
	•	Adjust balances (audit-logged)
	•	Set global limits & fees
	•	Integration Management
	•	API keys manager
	•	Enable/disable providers (fiat, crypto, services)
	•	Compliance & Logs
	•	Audit logs
	•	Security events
	•	AML/KYC status tracking (logic-ready)

⸻

🔌 Integration-Ready Architecture
	•	API gateway layer
	•	Provider abstraction layer
	•	Fiat payment adapters
	•	Crypto wallet adapters
	•	External services (SMS, email, KYC)
	•	Webhook listener system
	•	Environment-based configuration (sandbox / prod)
	•	Versioned APIs

⸻

🔐 Security Requirements
	•	Encrypted secrets & keys
	•	Hashing for credentials & PINs
	•	Idempotent transactions
	•	Rate limiting
	•	Admin action logging
	•	Secure wallet balance updates (atomic operations)

⸻

🧱 Tech Stack (Suggested but Flexible)
	•	Backend: FastAPI / Node / Laravel (clean layered structure)
	•	Database: PostgreSQL (ledger-based schema)
	•	Auth: Custom JWT + refresh tokens
	•	Frontend: Mobile-first (React / Flutter-ready APIs)
	•	QR support for P2P transfers

⸻

📁 Output Expectations
	•	Clean folder structure
	•	Database schema (users, wallets, transactions, admins, logs)
	•	Core API endpoints
	•	Admin dashboard endpoints
	•	Integration interfaces (empty adapters ready to plug)
	•	Clear comments explaining extensibility points

🧠 Mindset While Coding

“Build this as if it will become a national e-wallet, audited by regulators, and expanded later into crypto, remittance, and super-app services.”
